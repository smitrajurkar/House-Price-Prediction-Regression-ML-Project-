# 🏠 House Price Prediction ML Project

#📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can estimate the price of a house based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, and other property details.The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using real-world housing data.

#🚀 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

#📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Loading dataset  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Train-Test Split  
6. Model Building (Linear Regression)  
7. Model Evaluation (MAE, R² Score)  
8. Prediction and Visualization  

#🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression used for price prediction  
- Evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score


## 📊 Output
The model predicts house prices and compares actual vs predicted values using visualization graphs.
